The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from today and going backward) for which the stock price was less than or equal to today's price.

For example, if the price of a stock over the next 7 days were [100,80,60,70,60,75,85], then the stock spans would be [1,1,1,2,1,4,6].

Code:
stack<pair<int,int>s;/*stack to hold the price and result for the stacks*/
int next(int price){
/*int next(int price) Returns the span of the stock's price given that today's price is price.*/
int res=1;
while(!s.empty()&&s.top().first<=price)//aajke price se agar last prices kaam hai......
{
res+=s.top().second;//the second variable in the stack holds the result after checking for the previous elements wrt to current price element in the stack
s.pop();
}
s.push({price,res});
return res;
}
